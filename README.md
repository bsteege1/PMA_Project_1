# PMA_Project_1
COSC 4010 Binary Analysis Project 1

The purpose of our program is to analyze a directory of files and state whether or not we believe the files likely contain malware. Our code goes through and looks for strings, checks if the file is packed or obfuscated, runs the file through VirusTotal, and gets the compile time. 

For the second part of this project, we decided to change the compile time that is in the file. Now instead of whenever the file was originally compiled, it will show with the time that we have chosen to insert.
